## Welcome to Jail Manager

Jail Manager is the community that maintains JailMan. 

### JailMan
JailMan is a one-line iocage jail management and deployment tool for FreeNAS and FreeBSD.
If you are interested in using JailMan, please visit us on github [github](https://github.com/jailmanager/jailman/)

### Supported operating systems

While we always aim to improve, we have a limited capacity to support older or newer operating systems. Our focus is the current version of FreeNAS and, the future, TrueNAS CORE.
That being said: We do look forward to support more operating systems like FreeBSD and Linux.

### Roadmap

While we can't make promises due to the nature of opensource development, we aim to release frequent bugfixes aka minor releases (1.2.x releases) and less frequent major releases that will also change the way you interact with JailMan.

Our current roadmap is as follows:

- Next Minor release (1.2.3): Before 15-07-2020
- Next Major release (1.3.0): Before 01-09-2020
